# Decentra-Law - Project Description
A dApp that decentralizes the procedure of acquiring BAR Council licenses through on-chain relaying and verification of the documents and licenses.

The current certification process employed by the Bar Council of Kerala for eligible lawyers poses significant challenges and inefficiencies. The issuance of certificates of practice is carried out through a traditional, physical approach, resulting in a series of difficulties for legal practitioners. This antiquated method not only introduces delays and bureaucratic hurdles but also imposes geographic constraints, requiring lawyers to be physically present for the acquisition of their certificates. The physical nature of the process creates inconvenience for lawyers, particularly those situated in diverse locations across the region, exacerbating accessibility issues. The need for a more modern and efficient certification system becomes evident, calling for a transformation in the current practices to address these obstacles and streamline the certification process for eligible lawyers.
